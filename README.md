# Project4
In this project, I worked with a dataset that contains detailed information about various mobile phones, including their model, color, memory, RAM, battery capacity, rear camera specifications, front camera specifications, presence of AI lens, mobile height, processor, and, most importantly, the price. The primary goal was to develop a predictive model for mobile phone prices.
