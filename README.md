# Project4
In this project, I worked with a dataset that contains detailed information about various mobile phones, including their model, color, memory, RAM, battery capacity, rear camera specifications, front camera specifications, presence of AI lens, mobile height, processor, and, most importantly, the price. The primary goal was to develop a predictive model for mobile phone prices.
The following steps were performed 
Data Collection: Gather and clean the dataset.
Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Create and select relevant features for the model.
Model Development: Develop and train predictive models to estimate mobile phone prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
Model Tuning: Fine-tune the models to improve accuracy.
Results Presentation: Present the findings and model performance.
